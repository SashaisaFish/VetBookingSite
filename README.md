# VetBookingSite
This site is meant to create a calendar (of October) where user inputted data will appear.

The form takes information about the user's pet, which matches up with a pet in petData.js based on species and ID to give a picture of the pet. This information is then fed through newScript.js and appears on the correct day in the calendar with the pet's name and time. Clicking on each entry will enlarge the entry and make more details (picture of the pet, ID, species, price of the appointment) visible. Clicking the x button in the corner will return the entry to its original position. Currently, I have not gotten it working so this can happen more than once. Once you open and close an entry, you cannot open it again.
